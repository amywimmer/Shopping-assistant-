MEMORY CLEANUP - SHOPPING PROJECT (FULL EXPORT)

These items are still active in memory and should be backed up or cleared for a clean slate:

SHOPPING & PRICING LOGIC

- User has a Kroger card, Walmart+ membership, and Sam's Club membership.
- User shops on Amazon, especially for items only available there.
- All supplements on the user's shopping list should be in gummy form.
- User prefers crunchy peanut butter.
- User is not brand specific for lickable cat treats. They need at least 60 treats each month and are fine with either squeeze-ups or spoons. Spoons receive a 10% convenience value bump.
- User needs 8 bags of H-E-B store brand clumping litter, which is typically the best price.
- User considers H-E-B an always-included stop for shopping due to consistent savings on litter.
- User is okay with buying multiple packages of Kraft Singles or Hill Country Fare American cheese slices to reach the desired quantity (3 lbs / 72 ct).
- User prefers only A.1. brand for steak sauce, as they haven't found a store brand that compares in taste.
- User prefers Listerine brand for mouthwash, likely Cool Mint, as their household is brand specific for this product.
- User has hazelnut creamer on their list.
- User would typically buy two Nestlé Coffee mate Creamers to qualify for Kroger's $1.00 off 2 coupon, especially when the best price is on the 64 oz size.
- User wants a routine digital coupon sweep for their shopping list before each trip. They also receive personalized Kroger coupons and plan to send pictures for manual price updates.
- User wants Kroger fuel savings calculated under the assumption that fuel points will accumulate to at least the 100-point threshold each month, so partial points should be valued proportionally across items.
- User wants three Kroger fuel point scenarios calculated: standard (1x), Boost (2x), and 4x multiplier (from a coupon or special day).
- User has decided to assign a $5 PITA (pain in the ass) cost to Walmart+ next-day delivery to account for the inconvenience of delayed availability.
- User has decided to assign a $5 PITA (pain in the ass) cost to shopping at Joe V’s due to the inconvenience of in-store only shopping and no curbside.
- User wants to implement logic that reassigns items to the next-best store when the original best-price store isn’t worth the trip based on net savings. They prefer to start with reassigning items from the store with the least amount of savings.
- User wants the holistic reassignment logic to be dynamic—so if a new item is added that increases the total savings at a store (e.g., Joe V’s) enough to justify the PITA cost, items previously reassigned away should automatically be reassigned back.

PENDING FIX:
- Kraft Singles are still incorrectly assigned to H-E-B despite Joe V’s being deemed worth the trip. This logic needs to be addressed in the next session.
