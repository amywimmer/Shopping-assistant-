MEMORY CLEANUP - SHOPPING PROJECT

Please delete the following memory items:

- User prefers crunchy peanut butter.
- User has a Kroger card, Walmart+ membership, and Sam's Club membership.
- User shops on Amazon, especially for items only available there.
- All supplements on the user's shopping list should be in gummy form.
- User prefers Kraft and Hill Country Fare for cheese singles and is okay buying multiples.
- User prefers only A.1. brand for steak sauce.
- User prefers Listerine brand for mouthwash.
- User has hazelnut creamer on their list.
- User considers H-E-B an always-included stop for shopping due to consistent savings on litter.
- User needs 8 bags of H-E-B store brand clumping litter.
- User is not brand specific for lickable cat treats. They need at least 60 treats each month and are fine with squeeze-ups or spoons. Spoons receive a 10% convenience value bump.
- User receives personalized Kroger coupons and plans to send pictures for manual price updates.
- User would typically buy two Nestlé Coffee mate Creamers to qualify for Kroger's $1.00 off 2 coupon.
- User wants a routine digital coupon sweep for their shopping list before each trip.
- User wants Kroger fuel savings calculated under the assumption that fuel points will accumulate to at least the 100-point threshold each month.
- User wants three Kroger fuel point scenarios calculated: standard (1x), Boost (2x), and 4x multiplier (from a coupon or special day).
- User wants to implement logic that reassigns items to the next-best store when the original best-price store isn’t worth the trip (based on net savings). Reassign from the store with the least amount of savings.
- User wants the holistic reassignment logic to be dynamic—so if a new item is added that increases the total savings at a store (e.g., Joe V’s) enough to justify the PITA cost, items previously reassigned away should automatically be reassigned back.
- User has decided to assign a $5 PITA (pain in the ass) cost to Walmart+ next-day delivery and Joe V’s in-store shopping.

NOT FIXED YET:
- Kraft Singles are still incorrectly assigned to H-E-B. Logic needs review next session.
